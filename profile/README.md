# 📚 SKKU Vault

Welcome to my **SKKU Vault** — a collection of all the code, projects, and random chaos from my time at **Sungkyunkwan University**.

This org is basically a time capsule of:
- Course assignments 📝
- Projects 💻
- Lab work 🔬
- And probably a few "what was I thinking?" moments 🤦‍♀️

Feel free to poke around. It's messy, but it's real :)
